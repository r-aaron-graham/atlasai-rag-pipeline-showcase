# ðŸš€ How to Run These Notebooks

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atlasai-rag-pipeline-showcase.git
cd atlasai-rag-pipeline-showcase

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate atlasai-rag-env

jupyter lab

If none of these extras are needed, youâ€™re now **ready to package and push the full repository**.

Would you like me to:

- Bundle the **entire folder structure** and content into a downloadable `.zip` for upload?
- Or walk you through creating the repo in GitHub and pushing it manually?

Let me know how you'd like to wrap it!
